## Rubric

Update your committee's rubric here. After hitting save you should see a checkmark; if you do not hit save again. Just filling in fields DOES NOT save them; only hitting save will save the rubric. If you would like to have a separate rubric for your second topic, select the box to use the second topic.

**Only one chair at a time should be logged in and modifying this. Changes may be lost otherwise.**
