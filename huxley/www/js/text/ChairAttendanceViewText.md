## Attendance

Here you can take attendance for delegates. Note that confirming attendance will alert the advisor as to if their delegates have shown up to committee. The "Voting" column is for the convenience of the chair and is not visible to advisors.

**Only one chair at a time should be logged in. Changes may be lost otherwise.**
