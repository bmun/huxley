# Thank You

Thank you for registering for BMUN {{ conferenceSession }}! Country assignments will be made available soon in your Huxley account. You will be notified via email when assignments become available. A summary of fees is listed below:

### School Registration Fee
* ${{ conferenceRegistrationFee }}

### Delegate Registration Fee
* ${{ conferenceDelegateFee }} (per delegate)

### Payment Instructions
An electronic invoice will be sent to the primary email you provided for registration via our QuickBooks Accounting Software. You may view and pay your delegate fees here. This is the preferred method of payment. If you prefer sending a physical check, we ask that you compile delegate fees into ONE check - please do not have your students mail individual checks.

Cash and online payment via QuickBooks are the only two accepted forms of payment for BMUN 67.
