## Assignments

Here you can view your tentative assignments for BMUN {{ conferenceSession }}. If you would like to request more slots, please email [info@bmun.org](mailto:info@bmun.org). The assignment finalization deadline is January 22nd. After assignment finalization we will ask that you assign the delegates you have added in the delegates tab to the assignments given to you.

When you assign a delegate, he or she will receive an account in Huxley.
The information for this account will be emailed to the **delegate's email**;
therefore please verify the delegate's email is correct before assigning.
