## Position Paper Submission


- Choose a file then hit submit to turn in your paper.

- For double delegations, either delegate can upload the paper. 

- You can only submit one file for your delegation. This should contain your position paper for all topics. 

- If either delegate (assuming a double delegation) submits a paper, it will entirely overwrite any previous submission made by either delegate.

- After uploading, the green download button should appear. Click this to see the file you have uploaded.

- When considering time of submission, chairs will only look at the timestamp of the most recent upload. 

- Once your paper has been graded you will be unable to resubmit. You may resubmit until then.

- After your paper has been graded, you should be able to download the file and see comments left by your chairs.

**Refresh the page and try to download your paper after you submit; if the file you see is not what you expect you should re-upload the paper.**
