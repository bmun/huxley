## Position Paper Submission


- Choose a file then hit submit to turn in your paper.

- Accepted file types: **.pdf, .doc, .docx** (.doc & .docx are Microsoft Word documents). Other file types will not be graded.

- For double delegations, either delegate can upload the paper. 

- You can only submit **one file** for your delegation. This should contain your position paper for all topics. 

- All submission times are in **Pacific Standard Time**.

- The large influx of submissions near the deadline can slow the system, and result in your paper's timestamp being later than you expect it to be. **THIS IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO AVOID.** If you want to be safe, submit your paper at least thirty minutes before the deadline to account for unforseen difficulties.

- Any submission with a timestamp later than the deadline will be considered late.

- When considering time of submission, chairs will **only** look at the timestamp of the most recent upload. 

- If either delegate (assuming a double delegation) submits a paper, it will entirely overwrite any previous submission made by either delegate.

- After uploading, the green download button should appear. Click this to see the file you have uploaded.

- Once your paper has been graded you will be unable to resubmit. You may resubmit until then.

- After your paper has been graded, you should be able to download the file and see comments left by your chairs.

**Refresh the page and try to download your paper after you submit; if the file you see is not what you expect you should re-upload the paper. If you do not see a download button, then your submission did not go through and you should re-upload the paper.**
