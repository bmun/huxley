## Position Paper Submission

Here you can submit your delegation's position paper. For double delegations, either delegate can upload the paper. Please note that when considering time of submission, chairs will only look at the timestamp of the most recent upload.

**Once your paper has been graded, you will be unable to resubmit.**

**It is highly reccomended you refresh the page and download your paper after you submit; if the file you see is not what you expect you should re-upload the paper.**
