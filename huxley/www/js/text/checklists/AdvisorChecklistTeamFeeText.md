BMUN’s team fee is ${{ registrationFee }}, paid once for an entire delegation regardless of its total delegate count. 5-7 business days after registration you will receive an invoice from Quickbooks, our accounting system. This fee can be paid either via credit card through the Quickbooks invoice or via check made out to Berkeley Model United Nations sent to PO Box 4306, Berkeley, CA 94704-0306. If you’re going to be paying by check please let the treasurer know by emailing [treasurer@bmun.org](mailto:treasurer@bmun.org) with subject “[BMUN {{ conferenceSession }} Payment] YOUR SCHOOL NAME Check”. Once received, your check will be considered paid on the postmarked date for payment deadlines.

If you registered between **{{ regOpen }}** and **{{ roundOneEnd }}**, these fees are due **{{ roundOneEnd }}**.  
If you registered between **{{ roundTwoStart }}** and **{{ roundTwoEnd }}**, these fees are due **{{ roundTwoEnd }}**.  
If you registered between **{{ roundThreeStart }}** and **{{ roundThreeEnd }}**, these fees are due **{{ roundThreeEnd }}**.  
If you registered between **{{ roundFourStart }}** and **{{ regClose }}**, these fees are due **{{ regClose }}**.

Note that this fee is non-refundable and failure to pay this fee by your required deadline will result in placement on our waitlist. 

This checklist item is updated manually by BMUN's Treasurer, {{ conferenceTreasurer }}, every non-holiday Wednesday and Sunday night on a rolling basis. If you submitted a payment and this item has not been checked, please contact [treasurer@bmun.org](mailto:treasurer@bmun.org).
