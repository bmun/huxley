BMUN’s team fee is ${{ registrationFee }}, paid once for the entire delegation regardless of its total delegate count. This fee can be paid either via credit card through the Quickbooks invoice or via check made out to Berkeley Model United Nations sent to PO Box 4306, Berkeley, CA 94704-0306. If you will be using a different payment method than what you indicated at the time of registration application submission, please let the treasurer know by emailing [treasurer@bmun.org](mailto:treasurer@bmun.org). Once received, your check will be considered paid on the postmarked date for payment deadlines.	


If you registered between **{{ regOpen }}** and **{{ roundOneEnd }}**, these fees are due **{{ roundOneEnd }}**.  
If you registered between **{{ roundTwoStart }}** and **{{ roundTwoEnd }}**, these fees are due **{{ roundTwoEnd }}**.  
If you registered between **{{ roundThreeStart }}** and **{{ roundThreeEnd }}**, these fees are due **{{ roundThreeEnd }}**.  
If you registered between **{{ roundFourStart }}** and **{{ regClose }}**, these fees are due **{{ regClose }}**.

Your registration application will not be considered complete until your school fee payments are made. If your school fee is not paid by the last registration date for the round in which you submitted the registration application, your delegation will be assessed a $10 late fee and your application will be moved to the next registration round. Failure to pay the school fee by the round due date will result in your school being dropped to the next round of registration. 

This checklist item is updated manually by BMUN's Treasurer,  {{ conferenceTreasurer }}, every non-holiday Wednesday and Sunday night on a rolling basis. If your delegation is having difficulties making the payments on time, or if you submitted a payment and this item has not been checked, please contact [treasurer@bmun.org](mailto:treasurer@bmun.org).
