In order to ensure delegates have enough time to research their committee topics and that the BMUN secretariat has enough time to prepare for conference, schools will need to finalize their list of assignments by January 21st.  This can be done by clicking the “assignments” tab and selecting which delegates will be in which committees.  No changes can be made to assignments after **01/21**; dropped delegates may only receive a partial refund after **01/11** and on or before **01/31**.  After **01/31**, no refunds will be issued.
