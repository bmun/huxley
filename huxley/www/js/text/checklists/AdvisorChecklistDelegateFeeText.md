BMUN’s delegate fee is ${{ delegateFee }} per delegate. This fee can be paid either via credit card through the Quickbooks invoice or via check made out to Berkeley Model United Nations sent to PO Box 4306, Berkeley, CA 94704-0306. If you will be using a different payment method than what you indicated at the time of registration application submission, please let the treasurer know by emailing [treasurer@bmun.org](mailto:treasurer@bmun.org). Once received, your check will be considered paid on the postmarked date for payment deadlines.

If you registered between **{{ regOpen }}** and **{{ roundOneEnd }}**, these fees are due **{{ roundOneFeesDue }}**.  
If you registered between **{{ roundTwoStart }}** and **{{ roundTwoEnd }}**, these fees are due **{{ roundTwoFeesDue }}**.  
If you registered between **{{ roundThreeStart }}** and **{{ roundThreeEnd }}**, these fees are due **{{ roundThreeFeesDue }}**.  
If you registered between **{{ roundFourStart }}** and **{{ regClose }}**, these fees are due **{{ roundFourFeesDue }}**.  

The late fee on delegate fees is dependent on the delegation size at the time of the delegate fee deadline. In addition to the late fee, your delegation may face forfeiture of their country assignments if delegate fees are not paid by the deadline. Please see the Events Guide available on our website for details regarding late fees on delegate fees.

This checklist item is updated manually by BMUN's Treasurer, {{ conferenceTreasurer }}, every non-holiday Wednesday and Sunday night on a rolling basis. If your delegation is having difficulties making the payments on time, or if you submitted a payment and this item has not been checked, please contact [treasurer@bmun.org](mailto:treasurer@bmun.org).
