BMUNâ€™s delegate fee is $55 per delegate.  This fee can be paid either via check made out to Berkeley Model United Nations and sent to PO Box 4306, Berkeley, CA 94704-0306 or through an electronic invoice that will be sent through Quickbooks.  If you registered between 9/17 and 11/12, these fees are due 12/3; if you registered between 11/13 and 12/3, these fees are due 1/7; if you registered between 12/4 and 1/7, these fees are due 1/21.  Failure to meet these deadlines may result in country assignment forfeiture.

This checklist item is updated manually by BMUN's Treasurer, Alexander Liu, every non-holiday Wednesday and Sunday night on a rolling basis. If you submitted a payment and this item has not been checked, please contact info@bmun.org.
