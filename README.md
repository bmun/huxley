## About BMUN
The Berkeley Model United Nations conference is a high-school conference hosted every spring. Each year, we host over 1500 delegates from all over the country (and the world!), who compete in a simulation of the United Nations and other international/historical bodies to solve the world's most compelling problems.

## About Huxley
Our long-term vision is to make Huxley the **best Model UN software in the world**: an application that makes the conference experience smoother than it's ever been, for both advisors and secretariats.

That means Huxley should be:

- **Centralized**: No more scrambling with email, Google Docs, and various other applications. Everything a secretariat needs to manage a conference should be right here.
- **Flexible.** No two conferences are the same. Secretariats of any conference, large or small, should be able to choose Huxley.
- **Innovative.** It must provide unique features that make the conference experience richer for advisors and secretariats.

And of course, Huxley should be **delightful to use.** We're aiming to provide the highest-quality user experience available for Model UN applications, via a focus on UI and features designed around ease-of-use.

Huxley's built with [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com), with a frontend written in [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).
