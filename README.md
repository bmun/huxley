## About BMUN
The Berkeley Model United Nations conference is a high-school conference hosted every spring. Each year, we host over 1500 delegates from all over the country (and the world!), who compete in a simulation of the United Nations and other international/historical bodies to solve the world's most compelling problems.

## About Huxley
Our long-term vision is to make Huxley the **best Model UN software in the world**: an application that makes the conference experience smoother than it's ever been for advisors and secretariats. We want Huxley to be **delightful to use**, and we're aiming to provide a fantastic user experience via a focus on clear UI and thoughtful, easy-to-use features.

Huxley's built with [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com), with a frontend written in [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).
