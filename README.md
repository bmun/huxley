# Huxley
Huxley is a web application designed to manage the annual [Berkeley Model United Nations](http://bmun.org/) conference.

## About BMUN
The Berkeley Model United Nations conference is a high-school conference hosted every spring. Each year, we host over 1500 delegates from all over the country (and the world!), who compete in a simulation of the United Nations (as well as other international and historical bodies) to solve the world's most compelling problems.


## About Huxley
Huxley was initially conceived as a way to abstract away database access from club officers in order to maintain consistency of the data. As the size of our conference grew, so did the logistical complexity, prompting us to begin developing a web application to centralize our data and streamline its access. 

Huxley's built with [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com), a web development framework written in [Python](http://www.python.org). The frontend is simple HTML and CSS, and makes heavy use of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).
